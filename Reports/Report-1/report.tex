\section{Task Definition and Dataset Choice (1 page)}

\subsection{What phenomena or task will you work on?}

\subsection{What about this phenomena or task fundamentally involves code?}

\subsection{Does a dataset exist, or will you be collecting it, or does your task not require a dataset?}
If the dataset exists already, reference it here. If it doesn't, detail how you'll collect it and how long it will take, or justify why your task doesn't require a dataset.

\subsection{Expertise}
We have the following expertise in the underlying aspects required by this project
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Team member 1: Research paper in static analysis, ...
      \item Team member 2: Took NLP in Fall 2023, ...
      \item ...
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Dataset Analysis (1 page)}
\subsection{Dataset properties} (GBs, code languages, numbers of examples, ...)
\subsection{Instance analysis}
(use a small sample -- e.g. validation splits):
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Code diversity: e.g. syntactic complexity, API usage, input and output spaces
    \item If your task/dataset involves language: Lexical diversity, sentence length, ...
  \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Evaluation metrics}
What intrinsic (intermediate) and extrinsic (end-task-related) evaluations will you use to know if things are working?

\clearpage

\section{Related Work and Background}
Aim for 5 papers per person, which can go into the categories below.
\paragraph{Related Datasets} 

\paragraph{Baselines}

\paragraph{Prior Work}

\paragraph{Relevant Techniques}

\section{Baselines and Proposed Approach (1 page)}

\subsection{Baselines}
Ideally at least two baselines, although one is ok if it will be difficult to implement (e.g. no publicly released code or models).

We will ask you to have results from these, and analysis of them, in Report 2.

\subsection{Proposed Approach(es)}
What might you do beyond the baseline?

\subsection{Compute requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Files (if you have a large training dataset -- can fit in RAM?)
  \item Models (can fit on GCP/AWS GPUs?)
  \item Training (if you're training models, estimated GPU hours)
  \item Inference (how many instances in your task/dataset? Do you need to sample many outputs? Execute code?)
\end{enumerate}
